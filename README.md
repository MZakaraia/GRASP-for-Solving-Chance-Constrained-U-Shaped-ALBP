# GRASP for Solving Chance-Constrained U-Shaped ALBP
The GRASP.py file contains the code of the proposed GRASP algorithm for solving the chance-constrained U-shaped assembly line balancing problem. The GRASP.jupyter file is used to implement the desing of experiment trails that found in Taguchi_GRASP.csv. In addition, the jupyter file is used to obtain the result of implementing the algorithm on selected problems found in Computational Results.csv. The computational results are implemented to cover different values of chance probabilities in case of high and low variances. The files that are used to cover these probabilities are as follows: 
- CR_higher_var_0.90.csv
- CR_higher_var_0.95.csv
- CR_higher_var_0.975.csv
- CR_lower_var_0.90.csv
- CR_lower_var_0.95.csv
- CR_lower_var_0.975.csv
.The A-Greedy-Randomized-Adaptive-Search-for-Solving-Chance-Constrained-U-Shaped-Assembly-Line-Balancing-Problem.pdf file is the published paper related to this code.
